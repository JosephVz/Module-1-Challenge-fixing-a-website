# <Fixing some features of a website (Module 1 Homework)>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 

In order to learn certain bugs or feature of how a website works, it was important to look over an established website and notify certain problems with it that can be easily fixed.

- Why did you build this project?

This project helped me understand what a semi functional website looks like and what steps and/or direction to take in order to fix certain issues with the website. Of course it was a homework assignment however i found it useful to help get my foot in the doorway of a coding career, it helps me realize what some of my day to day life could be like if i manage to obtain a career in this field.

- What problem does it solve?

This solves the problem of simple bugs in the code such as how to fix the slow loading picture (as of writing this im not sure if i'll figure it out) and fixing a link that doesnt function using simple code. This shows how easy it is to mistype something or have something be non-functional. This activity also helps solve similar problems in the future and teaches you how to label html, fix css according to the html, and improve somebody elses code.

- What did you learn?

I learned that proper labels in the index.html are important in order to categorize and better understand what you are working with. Simply just naming them anything wont work and although it seems as if you may name everything <div> that doesn't mean that your final project should look like this. It may make it harder to navigate or update in the future. Editing this in the future i learned more of how to connect the html to the css as before it was a bit fuzzy in my brain but now i believe i have a really good grasp of it after this activity.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](C:\Users\Joseph Vanzandt\Desktop\new\Module-1-Challenge-fixing-a-website\assets\images\Capture-1.PNG)
    ```

    ```md
